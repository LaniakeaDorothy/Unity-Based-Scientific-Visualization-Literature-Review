This paper presents Dimmol (acronym for Distributed Immersive Multi-platform Molecular visualization), a scientific visualization application based on UnityMol, developed with the Unity game engine, and that uses the Unity Cluster Package to enable distributed and immersive visualization of molecular structures across multiple device of different types, with support to Google VR, molecular trajectory files, and master-host-slave rendering. Its goal is to improve and facilitate the way educators and researchers visualize molecular structures with students and partners. In order to demonstrate a possible use scenario for Dimmol, better understand the contributions of each platform it can be executed in, and gather performance data, three molecular visualizations are loaded on it and distributed to a graphic cluster, a laptop, a tablet, and a smartphone. Other possible uses are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT A key learning outcome for undergraduate biochemistry classes is a thorough understanding of the principles of protein structure. Traditional approaches to teaching this material, which include two\u2010dimensional (2D) images on paper, physical molecular modeling kits, and projections of 3D structures into 2D, are unable to fully capture the dynamic 3D nature of proteins. We have built a virtual reality application, Peppy, aimed at facilitating teaching of the principles of protein secondary structure. Rather than attempt to model molecules with the same fidelity to the underlying physical chemistry as existing, research\u2010oriented molecular modelling approaches, we took the more straightforward approach of harnessing the Unity video game physics engine. Indeed, the simplicity and limitations of our model are strengths in a teaching context, provoking questions and thus deeper understanding. Peppy allows exploration of the relative effects of hydrogen bonding (and electrostatic interactions more generally), backbone \u03c6/\u03c8 angles, basic chemical structure, and steric effects on a polypeptide structure in an accessible format that is novel, dynamic, and fun to use. Apart from describing the implementation and use of Peppy, we discuss the outcomes of deploying Peppy in undergraduate biochemistry courses.",

        "abstract": "Developers have long used game engines for visualizing virtual worlds for players to explore. However, using real-world data in a game engine is always a challenging task, since most game engines have very little support for geospatial data. This paper presents our findings from exploring the Unity3D game engine for visualizing large-scale topographic data from mixed sources of terrestrial laser scanner models and topographic map data. Level of detail (LOD) 3 3D models of two buildings of the Universitas Gadjah Mada campus were obtained using a terrestrial laser scanner converted into the FBX format. Mapbox for Unity was used to provide georeferencing support for the 3D model. Unity3D also used road and place name layers via Mapbox for Unity based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. LOD1 buildings were modeled from topographic map data using Mapbox, and 3D models from the terrestrial laser scanner replaced two of these buildings. Building information and attributes, as well as visual appearances, were added to 3D features. The Unity3D game engine provides a rich set of libraries and assets for user interactions, and custom C\\# scripts were used to provide a bird\u2019s-eye-view mode of 3D zoom, pan, and orbital display. In addition to basic 3D navigation tools, a first-person view of the scene was utilized to enable users to gain a walk-through experience while virtually inspecting the objects on the ground. For a fly-through experience, a drone view was offered to help users inspect objects from the air. The result was a multiplatform 3D visualization capable of displaying 3D models in LOD3, as well as providing user interfaces for exploring the scene using \u201con the ground\u201d and \u201cfrom the air\u201d types of first person view interactions. Using the Unity3D game engine to visualize mixed sources of topographic data creates many opportunities to optimize large-scale topographic data use.",

This paper will highlight how the software imports from common astronomy data formats and processes the information for loading into the Unity game engine. It will also describe what tools are currently available to the user and the various performance optimisations made for seamless use.

In comparison with the traditional ROOT-based event display, ELAINA provides better visual effects with the Unity engine. It is developed independently of the JUNO offline software but shares the same detector description and event data model in JUNO offline with interfaces.
